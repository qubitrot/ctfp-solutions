## ctfp-solutions

Here are my solutions to the challenges in Bartosz Milewski's excellent book, *Category Theory for Programmers.*

The book is freely available on [Bartosz's site](https://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/). A pdf copy can be found [here](https://github.com/hmemcpy/milewski-ctfp-pdf), and a physical copy can be purchased from [here](http://www.blurb.com/b/9008339-category-theory-for-programmers). 

Most of the diagrams were created with [tikzcd-editor](https://github.com/yishn/tikzcd-editor)
